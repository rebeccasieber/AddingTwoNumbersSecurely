# AddingTwoNumbersSecurely

This program adds two positive integers and prints their sum.
This program focuses on input validation and confirming that input
is infact a positive integer and properly hadling situations where
input is not valid. This program also checks for int
overflow not only on the user input side, but also when adding two 
integers. This version now accepts and removes commas from inputted
integers. It also adds commas as needed to the ending printout for better
readability. Finally, this version protects from buffer overflow and
off-by-one errors by adding two integers as strings into a stack container
of integers.
